!!! data cleaning and preprocessing!!!

1. Handle Missing Values

2. Remove Unnecessary Columns

3. Convert Data Types

4. Remove Duplicates

5. Encode Categorical Variables

6. Feature Engineering

7. Feature Scaling

Optional/Advanced Steps (not always needed for Titanic):
Outlier detection/handling
Remove highly correlated features
Address class imbalance

!!! Accuracy can be calculated from confusion matrix!!!
!!!correlation [-1,+1], -1 means one increase another one decrease, +1 means one increase another one increase, 0 means no correlation
